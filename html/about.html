                    Hi, I'm Parampal Singh Gill, a Software Developer based in Vancouver, BC. With more than 5 years of experience, I've mainly focused on 
                    backend development and also dabbled a bit in frontend work. I've become skilled in several programming languages like Python, Java, C#, C, 
                    and C++. I'm familiar with Agile methods like Scrum and tools such as Git and Jenkins for software development. My approach involves 
                    continuous testing, thorough research, and detailed technical documentation. I love learning and excel both in teamwork and solo projects. 
                    Right now, I'm looking for a challenging role where I can use my problem-solving skills to help a dynamic organization succeed.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I love tackling important challenges and crafting solutions that really matter. My goal is to make a positive difference wherever I go. 
                    I'm excited about the opportunity to join a fast-growing company where I can use my skills to help make big advancements. I want to work 
                    with a team that shares my passion for making the world a better place through creative ideas and actions.
                </p>
